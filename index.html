    <h1>Banana Nut Bread</h1>
        <p>
            This recipe is a family tradition. Not only does this make a <b>delicious, sweet, <i>and</i> savory</b> bread but it brings me and my family <b>joyful</b> memories.
        <br>
            Banana nut bread is so easy to make. It only takes a few ingredients. We haven't make this recipe when we have overripe bananas but no need to wait! It's worth going ahead and buying some bananas just to make this bread! So, here we go!
